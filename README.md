## Compiling
- To compile code just run './compile.sh' in the same directory as main.c.

## Running
- After compiling you can run the code with './compute_average' followed by either a list of numbers or the path to a csv_file containing a list of numbers.

## Generating CSV file
- I have included a python script that creates a file called random.csv which can be used to make a csv file with up to 1 million randomly generated floating point numbers between -1000000 and 1000000.
- The script can be run with './random_csv_generator.py'. Upon running it will prompt you to enter the amount of numbers you would like in the file. Enter a number and press the enter key and random.csv will be generated.
